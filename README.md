# Retrospective Board
This work-in-progress is built using React. The app is designed to capture thoughts on collaborative projects, and sorting them into three categories: "Went Well", "To Improve", and "Action Items".
## Installing the Retrospective Board
With node.js installed, and while inside of the project directory, simply run `npm install` followed by `npm start` to get up and running.
## Using the Retrospective Board
Click on a grey plus (+) button to add an item to the category. Clicking on the "Change Layout" button will change the layout to a one column layout. The delete and moving functions are coming soon.
